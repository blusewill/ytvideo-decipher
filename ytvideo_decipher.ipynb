            "[02:04.000 --> 02:05.000]  You click remove.\n",

            "[02:27.000 --> 02:28.000]  So don't do that.\n",
            "[02:28.000 --> 02:32.000]  As far as everything else in here, services has been a big thing.\n",
            "[02:32.000 --> 02:36.000]  I've been harping on and working on developing, getting these to where you can click this\n",
            "[02:36.000 --> 02:41.000]  and undo tweaks and get it reverted back to the exact state on startup.\n",
            "[02:41.000 --> 02:43.000]  Earlier in the week, we had some bad commits on that.\n",
            "[02:43.000 --> 02:44.000]  That was my bad.\n",
            "[02:44.000 --> 02:50.000]  And if you run this tool and you had some issues earlier in the week, just know if you run it now, everything's fine.\n",
            "[02:50.000 --> 02:53.000]  Just some quick things there.\n",
            "[02:53.000 --> 02:58.000]  Big updates for this one is Edge we've been working on.\n",
            "[02:58.000 --> 03:02.000]  Pat over on GitHub has been doing a lot of those commits.\n",
            "[03:02.000 --> 03:06.000]  I'll show a lot of the commits coming up here just shortly.\n",
            "[03:06.000 --> 03:11.000]  But another big quality of life is people are running this tool a lot.\n",
            "[03:11.000 --> 03:15.000]  Or let's say you just want it on a desktop or have a shortcut.\n",
            "[03:15.000 --> 03:21.000]  You now have create the shortcut and you can just toss it on your desktop or your documents or wherever you want.\n",
            "[03:21.000 --> 03:24.000]  You can even put it in your start menu if you want.\n",
            "[03:24.000 --> 03:32.000]  And what that does is you can just click it and it will actually run the command through PowerShell for you,\n",
            "[03:32.000 --> 03:38.000]  which makes it a little bit easier to run multiple times as some people don't like pulling up PowerShell with admin.\n",
            "[03:38.000 --> 03:42.000]  As far as the config, not too much has changed here.\n",
            "[03:42.000 --> 03:44.000]  Just some basic quality of life.\n",
            "[03:44.000 --> 03:46.000]  We are adding in a network reset.\n",
            "[03:46.000 --> 03:55.000]  NetSH int IP resets, probably something you've run if you've been in the IT field for any period of time and your network has problems on Windows.\n",
            "[03:55.000 --> 04:00.000]  We will be adding a network fix button coming up in the next update.\n",
            "[04:00.000 --> 04:07.000]  That's something that should, it's actually on the test branch right now, but it hasn't been pushed to live quite yet.\n",
            "[04:07.000 --> 04:15.000]  And as far as updates go, how I work with updates usually is I'll hit security updates and leave my system alone.\n",
            "[04:15.000 --> 04:23.000]  That makes sure I don't get some junk feature or some weather search bar down here on my task bar out of the blue.\n",

            "[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  I like to stick on security.\n",
            "[04:36.000 --> 04:42.000]  And then for the people that really just want to disable everything on updates, you can click this button.\n",

            "[05:25.000 --> 05:29.000]  That was just a quick little fix and then just a ton of quality of life here.\n",
            "[05:29.000 --> 05:35.000]  And as far as commits to the main branch, just in the past week, we've seen a ton of different commits.\n",
            "[05:35.000 --> 05:38.000]  Some big ones here is mostly typos and other things.\n",
            "[05:38.000 --> 05:43.000]  So if you were like, again, if you did stuff earlier in the week, you might have noticed, man, things are changing a lot.\n",

            "[05:50.000 --> 05:58.000]  Yeah, we had quite a bit of commits all coming from just a variety of contributors to I really wanted to shout out though.\n",

            "[06:01.000 --> 06:09.000]  He's done just such a great job for improving the speed and just kind of put in run spaces and designing a new format.\n",
            "[06:09.000 --> 06:14.000]  So we're doing a compilation and it makes just everything so much more modular.\n",
            "[06:14.000 --> 06:21.000]  I was a little apprehensive to it at first, but I really do love the new structure of when you till where everything's in his module\n",
            "[06:21.000 --> 06:25.000]  and then it gets compiled into that one PS one file people are running.\n",
            "[06:26.000 --> 06:29.000]  It just makes things easier to track when doing the development.\n",
            "[06:29.000 --> 06:31.000]  As far as other commits, another shout out to pad.\n",
            "[06:31.000 --> 06:35.000]  He's been working really hard on mainly getting edge removal.\n",
            "[06:35.000 --> 06:45.000]  We're removing the bat way of doing it, which it's a batch file that gets run and it strips it out and it makes it to where it can never come back.\n",
            "[06:45.000 --> 06:47.000]  That way is a little bit too aggressive.\n",
            "[06:47.000 --> 06:54.000]  And pad has been working on a new non intrusive way of just disabling it because a lot of people wanted to do like Bing chat\n",
            "[06:54.000 --> 06:59.000]  and install Firefox and just just a tidbit about that.\n",
            "[06:59.000 --> 07:03.000]  If you are just wanting Bing chat and you're like, I need to install edge for it.\n",
            "[07:03.000 --> 07:04.000]  Don't do that.\n",
            "[07:04.000 --> 07:11.000]  Get a user agent switcher and then just say, hey, I'm on edge and then just apply to active window.\n",
            "[07:11.000 --> 07:19.000]  And what that does is when you go to like Bing chat and you're like, hey, I need to chat with Bing instead of it denying you.\n",
            "[07:19.000 --> 07:21.000]  Began saying, hey, you're not on edge.\n",
            "[07:21.000 --> 07:23.000]  There's a better browser out there.\n",
            "[07:23.000 --> 07:24.000]  We need edge to use chat.\n",
            "[07:24.000 --> 07:29.000]  No, it's just all just Microsoft up to its old shenanigans.\n",
            "[07:29.000 --> 07:32.000]  Just use user agent switcher and say, hey, yeah, I'm on edge.\n",
            "[07:32.000 --> 07:34.000]  Totally on edge.\n",
            "[07:34.000 --> 07:35.000]  We're not on edge.\n",
            "[07:35.000 --> 07:36.000]  We're on brave.\n",
            "[07:36.000 --> 07:40.000]  So yeah, just another tidbit.\n",
            "[07:40.000 --> 07:46.000]  And then obviously, if you like to contribute and anything, head over to CTT store dot com.\n",
            "[07:46.000 --> 07:48.000]  Go pull up the windows toolbox.\n",
            "[07:48.000 --> 07:51.000]  This just gives an executable version of running this.\n",
            "[07:51.000 --> 07:53.000]  No real difference here.\n",
            "[07:53.000 --> 07:55.000]  You're not getting anything extra special.\n",
            "[07:55.000 --> 07:57.000]  Maybe in the future, we're going to tie in some other stuff.\n",
            "[07:57.000 --> 08:01.000]  I am working on some other development I might put in here.\n",
            "[08:01.000 --> 08:03.000]  But none of that's finalized right now.\n",
            "[08:03.000 --> 08:09.000]  It just gives like an offline executable that has basic tweaks and that one needs to be polished and updated.\n",
            "[08:09.000 --> 08:16.000]  And then another executable that's just a PowerShell wrapper that just runs all this as well.\n",
            "[08:16.000 --> 08:18.000]  But it just makes things a little easier to run.\n",
            "[08:18.000 --> 08:21.000]  But at the same time, don't feel compelled.\n",
            "[08:21.000 --> 08:26.000]  I just want to put that in there at the end here and just want to get everybody's feedback.\n",
            "[08:26.000 --> 08:29.000]  How are you guys liking it as far as the toolbox?\n",
            "[08:29.000 --> 08:38.000]  I really just love this past couple of weeks kind of bouncing ideas, closing issues, and just it's been it's been a lot of fun.\n",
            "[08:38.000 --> 08:45.000]  And I've really, really enjoyed the live streams and the back and forth I have with the community and also in the comments here on YouTube.\n",
            "[08:45.000 --> 08:46.000]  It's been great.\n",
