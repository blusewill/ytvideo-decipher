            "[00:11.600 --> 00:15.560]  Basically, if you missed that one, this is a Dell Netbook\n",
            "[00:15.840 --> 00:18.560]  that has been modified with some Nickelodeon flair.\n",
            "[00:18.560 --> 00:20.600]  We've got the slime here on the outside,\n",

            "[00:26.960 --> 00:30.320]  But there is a lot of cool software that comes pre-installed on this thing,\n",
            "[00:30.320 --> 00:33.360]  and well, you can check out that video if you want to learn more about it.\n",
            "[00:33.360 --> 00:37.040]  But on that video I got a few comments from you guys saying that,\n",

            "[00:46.880 --> 00:51.360]  why don't we try that out? Why don't we try to turn this thing into a Hackintosh?\n",

            "[00:53.520 --> 00:58.720]  that we'd use one of those custom Hackintosh distros that were around in the late 2000s.\n",

            "[01:14.640 --> 01:16.880]  because it's a netbook, I'm sure you figured that out.\n",

            "[01:29.120 --> 01:33.760]  All right, so I figured we'd boot into Windows XP here just before we get everything going.\n",
            "[01:33.760 --> 01:36.720]  And yeah, I kind of forgot about some of the bloatware we have on here.\n",
            "[01:36.720 --> 01:40.480]  We got this ARO 2011 like registry cleaner program that says,\n",
            "[01:40.480 --> 01:43.840]  you got to buy this software to fix 597 registry errors.\n",
            "[01:43.840 --> 01:45.600]  Like, oh no, man, what are we going to do?\n",
            "[01:46.480 --> 01:49.040]  Well, we're just going to overwrite the Windows XP installation.\n",
            "[01:49.040 --> 01:50.560]  That'll fix everything, right?\n",
            "[01:51.520 --> 01:53.440]  So yeah, we're going to get rid of all that.\n",
            "[01:53.440 --> 01:55.280]  Though that was not installed from the factory,\n",
            "[01:55.280 --> 01:57.600]  that was just something that the previous owner put on here.\n",
            "[01:57.600 --> 02:03.120]  So we're going to get our disk drive and I'm going to pop in the DVD.\n",
            "[02:04.240 --> 02:06.080]  And I believe we have to hit F12.\n",
            "[02:06.080 --> 02:07.360]  Yep, it looks like we do.\n",
            "[02:07.360 --> 02:10.560]  Okay, and we'll jump down to CD slash DVD.\n",
            "[02:10.560 --> 02:11.440]  Yeah, there we go.\n",
            "[02:11.440 --> 02:12.560]  Okay, press any key.\n",
            "[02:12.560 --> 02:13.120]  All right.\n",
            "[02:13.120 --> 02:17.360]  All right, it looks like our boot screen has been modified with a different Apple logo.\n",
            "[02:17.360 --> 02:20.720]  And I think a slightly different shade of gray in the background.\n",
            "[02:21.680 --> 02:24.960]  So yeah, we're off to a great start so far.\n",
            "[02:24.960 --> 02:26.960]  Let's hope it can stay that way.\n",
            "[02:28.720 --> 02:31.920]  All right, so we've got a familiar language selection screen\n",
            "[02:31.920 --> 02:36.800]  for anyone who's installed Mac OS 10.5 or 10.6, obviously.\n",
            "[02:36.800 --> 02:39.840]  And yeah, we do have a different wallpaper in the background.\n",
            "[02:39.840 --> 02:42.000]  These custom distros typically did that.\n",
            "[02:42.000 --> 02:43.520]  We also saw that with iDenim,\n",
            "[02:43.520 --> 02:48.880]  which was the distribution I used in the HP video or the video with the HP laptop.\n",
            "[02:48.880 --> 02:53.200]  You know, it's funny because I actually specifically remember this distro.\n",
            "[02:53.200 --> 02:57.680]  I think I actually used it back in 2009 or something.\n",
            "[02:57.680 --> 03:01.520]  I believe I had a virtual machine that I installed it in.\n",
            "[03:01.520 --> 03:06.000]  Or maybe it wasn't this specifically, but I know I had Mac OS 10 running\n",
            "[03:06.000 --> 03:10.320]  in a virtual machine on my Windows computer because I didn't have a Mac at the time.\n",
            "[03:10.320 --> 03:12.640]  And right here, we've got a super large window\n",
            "[03:12.640 --> 03:15.920]  that's like taken up the entire screen with the exception of the menu bar up here.\n",
            "[03:15.920 --> 03:17.360]  So we're going to hit on continue.\n",
            "[03:17.360 --> 03:19.920]  And this is 10.6.3.\n",
            "[03:19.920 --> 03:22.000]  So it's dated June 2010.\n",
            "[03:22.000 --> 03:22.880]  Read me, please.\n",
            "[03:22.880 --> 03:27.600]  Okay, welcome to the iATKOS S3 installation.\n",
            "[03:27.600 --> 03:29.920]  This is the second version of the S3.\n",
            "[03:29.920 --> 03:33.040]  The Oscar goes to Apple and the OS 10.6 community.\n",
            "[03:33.040 --> 03:37.280]  So these are all the like thank you notes and everything to all the people who helped on this.\n",
            "[03:37.840 --> 03:42.800]  Yeah, it says right here, DVD designed for non-Apple x86 Intel CPU computers.\n",
            "[03:43.520 --> 03:46.160]  So you need a compatible motherboard, obviously.\n",
            "[03:46.160 --> 03:49.920]  I believe we have what, how much RAM do we have in this, by the way?\n",
            "[03:49.920 --> 03:51.360]  We've got one gig of RAM.\n",
            "[03:51.360 --> 03:52.800]  So it needs half of that.\n",
            "[03:52.800 --> 03:53.920]  So we're good there.\n",
            "[03:53.920 --> 03:58.720]  We've got plenty of hard disk space, though it looks like it does recommend one gig of RAM.\n",
            "[03:58.720 --> 04:00.960]  So yeah, we'll see how well this runs.\n",
            "[04:00.960 --> 04:04.160]  I mean, people in the comments mentioned that, you know, it works.\n",
            "[04:04.160 --> 04:08.560]  I don't know how well that is going to work performance wise, but we'll see.\n",
            "[04:08.560 --> 04:10.720]  So we're going to definitely do a clean installation.\n",

            "[04:23.680 --> 04:27.280]  And we'll call this Hackintosh HD.\n",
            "[04:27.280 --> 04:28.800]  And let's hit install.\n",
            "[04:28.800 --> 04:30.160]  Actually, I want to hit on customize.\n",
            "[04:30.160 --> 04:33.520]  There's something I failed to do in the HP Hackintosh video.\n",
            "[04:33.520 --> 04:41.040]  Yeah, this is where we get options for patches and drivers and stuff that we definitely want to make sure that we select in here.\n",
            "[04:42.320 --> 04:43.840]  So VGA.\n",
            "[04:43.840 --> 04:48.000]  This has an Intel graphics media accelerator 950.\n",
            "[04:48.000 --> 04:52.800]  So we're going to go down here and graphics media accelerator 950.\n",
            "[04:52.800 --> 04:53.280]  There it is.\n",
            "[04:53.280 --> 04:56.720]  So we'll grab that and oh, there's two of them in here.\n",
            "[04:57.440 --> 04:59.520]  Looks like two different builds.\n",
            "[04:59.520 --> 05:01.840]  I wonder what happens if we just get both of them.\n",

            "[05:08.960 --> 05:11.040]  So yeah, you want to make sure you hit that.\n",
            "[05:11.040 --> 05:16.800]  And then now we can hit install and hopefully it'll just work out.\n",
            "[05:16.800 --> 05:19.280]  This has been pretty seamless so far.\n",
            "[05:19.280 --> 05:22.160]  So yeah, let's hope it stays that way.\n",
            "[05:22.160 --> 05:23.440]  And would you look at that?\n",
            "[05:23.440 --> 05:24.320]  Here we go.\n",
            "[05:24.320 --> 05:26.080]  It's installed successfully.\n",
            "[05:26.080 --> 05:27.360]  At least it seems that way.\n",
            "[05:27.360 --> 05:30.640]  We'll see if it actually is able to boot into the operating system.\n",
            "[05:31.280 --> 05:36.080]  And I'm curious if all of the drivers that I selected are going to work.\n",

            "[05:44.720 --> 05:46.000]  which I would imagine it would.\n",
            "[05:46.800 --> 05:50.240]  But yeah, there was only one sound driver to select, I think.\n",
            "[05:50.240 --> 05:54.240]  So I hope that the default one it has in here works.\n",
            "[05:54.240 --> 05:57.920]  But yeah, I did select the display adapter.\n",
            "[05:57.920 --> 06:04.800]  I selected the wireless adapter and the wired ethernet adapter that this computer has.\n",
            "[06:04.800 --> 06:07.760]  And hopefully all those things will be able to work.\n",
            "[06:07.760 --> 06:11.760]  And maybe if the wireless adapter doesn't work, we can use the wired adapter to get online.\n",
            "[06:11.760 --> 06:14.400]  But I will say it has been on this screen for a little while.\n",
            "[06:14.400 --> 06:17.840]  And booting up from the disk took a long time.\n",
            "[06:17.840 --> 06:20.160]  It took probably like 10 minutes.\n",
            "[06:20.160 --> 06:21.520]  And I'm not exaggerating there.\n",
            "[06:21.520 --> 06:23.520]  It took a decent amount of time.\n",
            "[06:24.160 --> 06:25.920]  Of course, it was booting off of the CD.\n",
            "[06:25.920 --> 06:28.240]  The hard drive should be faster.\n",
            "[06:28.240 --> 06:29.920]  It looks like the Apple logo went away.\n",
            "[06:31.200 --> 06:35.280]  So let's see if it's going to load the iconic intro video\n",
            "[06:35.280 --> 06:37.680]  that I will have to mute if the sound actually works.\n",
            "[06:37.680 --> 06:39.680]  So you guys won't know if the sound works or not.\n",
            "[06:41.840 --> 06:42.800]  Oh, wait a second.\n",
            "[06:44.400 --> 06:45.280]  Listen to that.\n",
            "[06:51.920 --> 06:52.560]  What?\n",
            "[06:52.560 --> 06:55.040]  Okay, I don't know if I can have this audio play through here.\n",
            "[06:55.040 --> 06:58.720]  It might be in the Content ID system, but it's right now playing a cover\n",

            "[07:01.920 --> 07:05.200]  I don't know who the covers by, but nothing's showing up on the screen\n",
            "[07:05.200 --> 07:07.600]  other than just this gray screen.\n",
            "[07:07.600 --> 07:10.160]  Like the Apple logo went away, but we still have this.\n",
            "[07:10.880 --> 07:12.640]  So I don't really know what.\n",
            "[07:12.640 --> 07:14.400]  I mean, at least the sound driver works.\n",
            "[07:14.400 --> 07:15.600]  We know that.\n",
            "[07:15.600 --> 07:19.200]  But yeah, I really don't know what's going on.\n",
            "[07:19.200 --> 07:23.360]  I'm assuming it loaded the setup process maybe.\n",
            "[07:24.320 --> 07:27.200]  And this is what's replacing the intro video.\n",
            "[07:27.200 --> 07:30.240]  Maybe we just have to wait for the song to finish or something.\n",
            "[07:30.240 --> 07:32.400]  I mean, yeah, I literally cannot stop this.\n",
            "[07:32.400 --> 07:34.320]  And I can't even turn the volume down.\n",
            "[07:34.320 --> 07:35.360]  Although, wait a second.\n",
            "[07:36.640 --> 07:39.440]  No, I cannot turn the volume down.\n",
            "[07:39.440 --> 07:42.000]  The control on the keyboard is not working.\n",
            "[07:42.000 --> 07:46.160]  So we're just stuck here, forced to listen to staying alive.\n",
            "[07:46.160 --> 07:47.760]  This cover of staying alive.\n",
            "[07:49.360 --> 07:51.120]  Okay, I think it's fading out.\n",
            "[07:53.840 --> 07:57.840]  Oh, my gosh.\n",
            "[07:57.840 --> 07:59.440]  Okay, let me try command Q.\n",
            "[08:00.160 --> 08:03.280]  My guess is there's some sort of issue with the display driver.\n",
            "[08:05.120 --> 08:07.120]  Maybe I did I select the wrong one?\n",
            "[08:07.120 --> 08:10.160]  I mean, I picked the one that corresponded to the...\n",
            "[08:11.600 --> 08:13.920]  Maybe we have to go through and reinstall this again.\n",
            "[08:16.080 --> 08:18.400]  But let's just, I mean, evidently we're not getting anywhere.\n",
            "[08:18.400 --> 08:20.800]  I can't hit anything on the keyboard.\n",
            "[08:20.800 --> 08:21.920]  Nothing is...\n",
            "[08:21.920 --> 08:24.800]  Although, I wonder if maybe the USB...\n",
            "[08:24.800 --> 08:27.040]  Because I do have a USB keyboard plugged into this.\n",
            "[08:27.040 --> 08:28.160]  Maybe that drive...\n",
            "[08:28.160 --> 08:28.960]  Oh, yeah.\n",
            "[08:28.960 --> 08:34.000]  I just noticed that on the mouse here, the laser is not on.\n",
            "[08:34.000 --> 08:35.440]  So yeah, it's not...\n",
            "[08:35.440 --> 08:38.400]  The USB keyboard is not working because I've got the mouse plugged into the keyboard.\n",
            "[08:38.400 --> 08:44.720]  So let's try hitting command Q or what would have been command Q on the laptop.\n",
            "[08:44.720 --> 08:45.920]  No, that's not doing anything.\n",
            "[08:46.080 --> 08:52.080]  I can't hit escape or enter or anything to get this to go away.\n",
            "[08:52.080 --> 08:55.040]  So let's just try to do a force restart here.\n",

            "[08:57.440 --> 08:59.440]  It's doing the same thing again.\n",
            "[08:59.440 --> 09:00.960]  No, I don't want to...\n",
            "[09:00.960 --> 09:02.960]  Stop.\n",
            "[09:02.960 --> 09:03.840]  Oh, my...\n",
            "[09:03.840 --> 09:10.640]  Okay, I'm going to go through the setup process again and modify those customization settings.\n",
            "[09:11.120 --> 09:15.920]  My current theory is it's a display driver problem, but I could be completely wrong.\n",
            "[09:15.920 --> 09:22.080]  But let's find out or I'm going to find out and come back to and let you find out what I know or what I find out.\n",
            "[09:22.080 --> 09:23.440]  Yeah, that makes sense, right?\n",
            "[09:23.440 --> 09:24.240]  Whatever.\n",
            "[09:24.240 --> 09:25.360]  I'll be back in a minute.\n",
            "[09:25.360 --> 09:25.920]  All right.\n",
            "[09:25.920 --> 09:27.360]  So good and bad news.\n",
            "[09:27.360 --> 09:29.680]  The good news is I fixed the display problem.\n",
            "[09:29.680 --> 09:37.360]  It was an issue with the driver that I had selected because I had two selected because there were two drivers for the interface.\n",
            "[09:38.320 --> 09:43.440]  Because there were two drivers for the Intel integrated graphics that we have in this thing.\n",
            "[09:43.440 --> 09:46.240]  So I only have one driver selected now.\n",
            "[09:46.240 --> 09:51.440]  And you can see that we now get a display output after the boot screen.\n",
            "[09:51.440 --> 09:56.720]  The bad news is and what's kind of strange is it says there isn't a keyboard connected to the computer.\n",
            "[09:56.720 --> 10:01.440]  Now, I've got a USB keyboard and mouse plugged in and they're not working.\n",
            "[10:01.440 --> 10:04.960]  So evidently the USB driver hasn't been loaded properly.\n",
            "[10:04.960 --> 10:12.320]  But what's odd is I can modify the brightness by using the keyboard here.\n",
            "[10:12.320 --> 10:14.080]  OK, well now apparently I can't.\n",
            "[10:14.080 --> 10:15.520]  I was able to before.\n",
            "[10:15.520 --> 10:18.080]  Luckily, I was recording so I can show you that footage.\n",
            "[10:18.880 --> 10:21.200]  So yeah, that was working.\n",
            "[10:21.200 --> 10:22.000]  Now it's not.\n",
            "[10:22.000 --> 10:24.160]  But you know, I can't use this keyboard at all.\n",
            "[10:24.160 --> 10:27.680]  I can't move the trackpad, like move my finger on the trackpad.\n",
            "[10:27.680 --> 10:29.120]  It doesn't move the cursor around.\n",
            "[10:29.120 --> 10:33.120]  I also can't adjust the freaking volume and this song is still playing in the background.\n",
            "[10:33.120 --> 10:37.760]  Yeah, I have restarted multiple times and we just get the same thing.\n",
            "[10:37.760 --> 10:40.240]  So this isn't anything that can be fixed by restart.\n",
            "[10:40.240 --> 10:43.680]  So we're going to have to go through the installation process again.\n",
            "[10:44.400 --> 10:48.560]  And maybe try to modify some other settings.\n",
            "[10:48.560 --> 10:52.320]  I think there was something about a USB driver, but I checked that.\n",
            "[10:53.440 --> 10:54.880]  So I don't know.\n",
            "[10:56.480 --> 11:00.800]  We're just going to restart and boot up from the disk again.\n",
            "[11:00.800 --> 11:05.440]  All right, after a few minutes of waiting for the boot up process to finish,\n",
            "[11:05.440 --> 11:08.400]  we're here again on the installation screen,\n",
            "[11:08.400 --> 11:10.720]  which is like what the second time that you guys are seeing this,\n",
            "[11:10.720 --> 11:14.320]  but like the third or fourth time that I'm seeing it.\n",
            "[11:14.320 --> 11:16.240]  Well, it is an MJD video after all.\n",
            "[11:16.240 --> 11:17.680]  Something has to go wrong.\n",
            "[11:17.680 --> 11:21.200]  And in this case, well, I hope it's something that we're able to fix.\n",
            "[11:21.200 --> 11:24.800]  I mean, worst case scenario, I'm thinking of just using that same\n",
            "[11:25.360 --> 11:30.400]  iDeneb CD that we used in the Hackintosh video with the HP laptop.\n",
            "[11:31.440 --> 11:33.200]  But you know, we already took a look at that dish.\n",
            "[11:33.200 --> 11:35.600]  Or I kind of wanted to explore this other one\n",
            "[11:35.600 --> 11:38.480]  and kind of see how it differs from regular Mac OS X.\n",
            "[11:38.480 --> 11:41.520]  Which so far, especially with the music that you have\n",
            "[11:41.520 --> 11:44.720]  during the user account creation process and all that,\n",
            "[11:45.840 --> 11:47.440]  it's pretty wild to see.\n",
            "[11:47.440 --> 11:49.040]  I'm scrolling through this document here,\n",
            "[11:49.040 --> 11:51.680]  and I'm down here at the Simple Troubleshooting Guide.\n",
            "[11:51.680 --> 11:56.000]  And there's nothing about it not detecting USB devices or the keyboard and mouse.\n",
            "[11:56.720 --> 11:59.280]  It's got waiting for root device, CPU errors,\n",
            "[11:59.280 --> 12:01.680]  blur black screen during HDD boot.\n",
            "[12:01.680 --> 12:04.880]  Nothing that really pertains to us, unfortunately.\n",
            "[12:04.880 --> 12:06.320]  One thing I do want to show you,\n",
            "[12:06.320 --> 12:12.240]  I will have put a text blurb up on screen during the first run through of setup,\n",
            "[12:12.240 --> 12:16.880]  but there is this hardware info app that you can get to from utilities,\n",
            "[12:16.880 --> 12:20.080]  which shows you the hardware you've got installed\n",
            "[12:20.080 --> 12:21.520]  so that you can take a note of this.\n",
            "[12:21.520 --> 12:25.840]  And then when you click that customize button on the drive selection screen,\n",
            "[12:25.840 --> 12:28.080]  you can make sure you get the right drivers and everything.\n",
            "[12:28.880 --> 12:30.960]  So yeah, we can just close out of this.\n",
            "[12:30.960 --> 12:34.560]  It's also pretty funny because this app is super basic,\n",
            "[12:34.560 --> 12:36.640]  and they haven't even changed some of the placeholder.\n",
            "[12:36.640 --> 12:39.120]  Like it says window up here, it says button down here.\n",
            "[12:39.120 --> 12:41.120]  This button doesn't actually do anything.\n",
            "[12:41.120 --> 12:44.320]  And when you close out of it, it doesn't automatically quit the application.\n",
            "[12:44.320 --> 12:47.520]  You have to go up here and click on quit new application.\n",
            "[12:47.520 --> 12:48.560]  Let's actually go to about.\n",
            "[12:48.560 --> 12:50.400]  I'm curious if they change this.\n",
            "[12:50.400 --> 12:52.240]  Hardware info version 0.1.\n",
            "[12:52.240 --> 12:53.920]  Okay, copyright 2007.\n",
            "[12:53.920 --> 12:55.840]  So yeah, we'll get out of that.\n",
            "[12:55.840 --> 12:57.760]  And oh wait, we got to go into disk utility.\n",
            "[12:57.760 --> 12:58.400]  Hang on a second.\n",
            "[12:58.400 --> 12:59.760]  I'm getting ahead of myself.\n",
            "[12:59.760 --> 13:04.000]  And we're racing and it's remounting and we're done.\n",
            "[13:04.000 --> 13:04.560]  Look at that.\n",
            "[13:05.360 --> 13:06.960]  And now we'll select this.\n",
            "[13:06.960 --> 13:08.320]  We'll go to customize.\n",
            "[13:08.320 --> 13:12.400]  I believe I had this USB patch selected last time.\n",
            "[13:12.400 --> 13:15.040]  So these are all the default settings, by the way,\n",
            "[13:15.040 --> 13:18.480]  what it's got already selected in here, but I'm going to select USB.\n",
            "[13:18.480 --> 13:22.240]  I don't think I had this laptop hardware thing checked under drivers.\n",
            "[13:22.880 --> 13:26.880]  So I'm going to make sure to get that under VGA here.\n",
            "[13:27.360 --> 13:29.680]  We got to go down here to Intel GMA 950.\n",
            "[13:29.680 --> 13:31.840]  And this was the one that I got that worked.\n",
            "[13:31.840 --> 13:33.040]  So we'll grab that.\n",
            "[13:33.040 --> 13:34.720]  But okay, I think that we're good.\n",
            "[13:34.720 --> 13:38.240]  Let's just hit okay and hit install.\n",
            "[13:38.240 --> 13:39.760]  So we're going to let it do its thing.\n",
            "[13:39.760 --> 13:43.680]  It is going to take about 19 minutes and probably a little more than that actually.\n",
            "[13:43.680 --> 13:49.520]  And I'll be back with you guys, hopefully looking at the setup assistant again,\n",
            "[13:49.520 --> 13:52.960]  where we can actually move the mouse around and type on the keyboard.\n",
            "[13:53.600 --> 13:55.600]  Oh my gosh, a kernel panic.\n",
            "[13:55.600 --> 13:58.400]  Who could have ever predicted that?\n",
            "[13:58.400 --> 14:03.840]  Yeah, the installation finished and yeah, it's just kernel panic trying to boot up.\n",
            "[14:03.840 --> 14:06.240]  So we're going to have to do a force restart.\n",
            "[14:06.240 --> 14:11.360]  And so we might have just created more problems for ourselves.\n",
            "[14:12.400 --> 14:16.320]  Well, after a lengthy boot process, we got nothing.\n",
            "[14:16.320 --> 14:20.640]  The same exact kernel panic, which just lovely.\n",
            "[14:20.640 --> 14:21.840]  So you know what?\n",
            "[14:21.840 --> 14:25.440]  We're just going to get rid of this disk for now.\n",
            "[14:25.440 --> 14:29.920]  Because I think this is just freaking cursed, at least on this computer.\n",
            "[14:29.920 --> 14:32.560]  And we're going to do something that I probably should have done from the very beginning.\n",
            "[14:32.560 --> 14:37.440]  And just using a regular Mac OS 10.6 retail CD\n",
            "[14:37.440 --> 14:41.520]  and modify it with some software to get it to install on here.\n",
            "[14:41.520 --> 14:44.480]  And to do that, I need to grab one of my old Macs.\n",
            "[14:44.480 --> 14:47.760]  And speaking of old Macs, Leno doesn't have any of that.\n",
            "[14:47.760 --> 14:51.520]  But what they do have are a wide offering of cloud computing services\n",
            "[14:51.520 --> 14:56.400]  that give you the tools you need to scale and deploy applications of all shapes and sizes.\n",
            "[14:56.400 --> 15:00.080]  Whether you want to host a game server or a content management system.\n",
            "[15:00.080 --> 15:04.400]  Their Linux based virtual machines come equipped with enterprise level capabilities\n",
            "[15:04.400 --> 15:08.880]  and predictable no lock in pricing beginning at just $5 per month.\n",
            "[15:08.880 --> 15:12.160]  And with the wide selection of apps available in their marketplace,\n",
            "[15:12.160 --> 15:15.280]  you won't need to spend days on end getting everything set up.\n",
            "[15:15.280 --> 15:17.760]  Linode was acquired by Akamai a while ago,\n",
            "[15:17.840 --> 15:20.960]  and they're already expanding their global network of data centers\n",
            "[15:20.960 --> 15:23.840]  to accommodate more customers in more places.\n",
            "[15:23.840 --> 15:28.560]  And you can test drive all of it just by heading over to leno.com slash MichaelMJD\n",
            "[15:28.560 --> 15:29.840]  and signing up for an account.\n",
            "[15:29.840 --> 15:34.240]  And as I thank you for watching this video, you'll receive a $100 free credit\n",
            "[15:34.240 --> 15:38.320]  that you can spend on any of their cloud computing services for 60 days.\n",
            "[15:38.320 --> 15:43.040]  So be sure to check them out and huge thanks again to Linode for making this episode possible.\n",
            "[15:43.040 --> 15:45.680]  All right, so just to give you a little rundown of what I'm doing here,\n",
            "[15:45.680 --> 15:49.040]  I actually found this old tutorial from Gizmodo,\n",
            "[15:49.600 --> 15:55.040]  which details how to get Snow Leopard running on a Dell Mini 10 V,\n",
            "[15:55.040 --> 15:58.560]  which is again what this laptop is based on.\n",
            "[15:58.560 --> 16:05.280]  And so what you do is I've just copied over or rather restored this USB flash drive.\n",
            "[16:05.280 --> 16:10.000]  I've got plugged into the MacBook from a Snow Leopard install disk image.\n",
            "[16:10.000 --> 16:10.720]  There it is.\n",
            "[16:10.720 --> 16:13.280]  Now, of course, it's not going to let us run the application here\n",
            "[16:13.280 --> 16:15.360]  because we're on a newer version of OS X.\n",
            "[16:15.360 --> 16:20.880]  But we don't have to do that because we need to use this program called Netbook Installer,\n",
            "[16:20.880 --> 16:23.840]  which is this super old program.\n",
            "[16:23.840 --> 16:27.120]  It's actually hosted over here on Google Code Archive.\n",
            "[16:27.120 --> 16:30.640]  And so I just got the latest version here from November 24th, 2010.\n",
            "[16:31.280 --> 16:37.760]  And evidently, all we have to do is run it and we select Mac OS X install DVD,\n",
            "[16:37.760 --> 16:42.400]  create booter, and then prepare drive and then type in our password.\n",
            "[16:42.400 --> 16:44.080]  And I guess that's it.\n",
            "[16:44.080 --> 16:45.440]  Installation complete.\n",
            "[16:45.440 --> 16:45.920]  All right.\n",
            "[16:45.920 --> 16:47.280]  So we'll hit continue.\n",
            "[16:47.280 --> 16:50.800]  And so now we should just be able to plug this drive into...\n",
            "[16:50.800 --> 16:52.160]  Whoops, I don't want to do that.\n",
            "[16:52.160 --> 16:55.200]  We should be able to plug this drive back into the NIC Netbook.\n",
            "[16:55.200 --> 16:55.680]  All right.\n",
            "[16:55.680 --> 16:59.920]  The drive's going in and we're powering it on.\n",
            "[16:59.920 --> 17:01.440]  And there's USB storage.\n",
            "[17:02.560 --> 17:03.920]  It's not looking good so far.\n",
            "[17:04.720 --> 17:04.960]  OK.\n",
            "[17:04.960 --> 17:09.760]  I restarted and booted into the BIOS here to check the BIOS version, which is A06.\n",
            "[17:09.760 --> 17:14.880]  Now, the article was originally written to say that you had to downgrade the BIOS version\n",
            "[17:14.880 --> 17:15.920]  to get this to work.\n",
            "[17:15.920 --> 17:19.520]  But then it was updated and said that this version of the BIOS works fine\n",
            "[17:19.520 --> 17:21.760]  with the latest version of Netbootmaker.\n",
            "[17:21.760 --> 17:26.560]  Now, I'm guessing at some point Netbootmaker's name was changed to Netbook installer\n",
            "[17:26.560 --> 17:28.720]  because that's the application that I got.\n",
            "[17:28.720 --> 17:31.200]  But there is an older version that's named Netbootmaker.\n",
            "[17:31.200 --> 17:36.320]  So we could try that, you know, if this doesn't work.\n",
            "[17:36.320 --> 17:38.080]  Let's go down to USB storage.\n",
            "[17:38.080 --> 17:40.080]  I would think it would be doing something.\n",
            "[17:41.040 --> 17:41.360]  All right.\n",
            "[17:41.360 --> 17:45.040]  It's been sitting here for a little while and nothing's happening.\n",
            "[17:45.040 --> 17:48.880]  So, yeah, let's just turn this back off.\n",
            "[17:48.880 --> 17:51.040]  Well, well, well, would you look at this?\n",
            "[17:51.040 --> 17:52.960]  We actually got it to boot.\n",
            "[17:53.600 --> 17:58.400]  And what I had to do off camera is install Mac OS X Snow Leopard\n",
            "[17:58.400 --> 18:05.840]  on my mid-2009 MacBook Pro here and create the bootable USB from that,\n",
            "[18:05.840 --> 18:10.880]  you know, using that version of Disk Utility and then running the program\n",
            "[18:10.880 --> 18:12.640]  that I mentioned in the last clip.\n",
            "[18:12.640 --> 18:15.920]  So, yeah, it wasn't working before on a more modern version of OS X.\n",
            "[18:15.920 --> 18:17.440]  It worked on this version.\n",
            "[18:17.440 --> 18:19.760]  Sometimes it's just best not to question things.\n",
            "[18:19.760 --> 18:21.280]  It could be a multitude of things.\n",
            "[18:21.280 --> 18:25.040]  It could be the application, you know, that was written for 10.6,\n",
            "[18:25.040 --> 18:30.960]  that Netbook boot application might just have not worked properly on El Capitan,\n",
            "[18:30.960 --> 18:32.960]  which is what I was running on the MacBook.\n",
            "[18:32.960 --> 18:33.840]  I'm still running it on.\n",
            "[18:33.840 --> 18:35.280]  It's just on a different partition.\n",
            "[18:35.280 --> 18:37.600]  But anyway, so we're going to click on English.\n",
            "[18:37.600 --> 18:40.640]  And yeah, the resolution here is definitely pretty low\n",
            "[18:40.640 --> 18:45.200]  because this window is normally not, you know, from top to bottom.\n",
            "[18:45.200 --> 18:46.800]  It's usually like in the center of the screen.\n",
            "[18:47.520 --> 18:51.040]  But we already have, let's just go into, speaking of Disk Utility,\n",
            "[18:51.040 --> 18:52.560]  let's go into Disk Utility here.\n",
            "[18:53.200 --> 18:56.560]  And let me just make sure this drive is formatted.\n",
            "[18:56.560 --> 18:58.080]  Actually, yeah, I'm going to have to format it\n",
            "[18:58.080 --> 19:04.800]  because we still have the non-working install of IATK OS on here.\n",
            "[19:05.600 --> 19:06.240]  What the...\n",
            "[19:06.240 --> 19:07.360]  Oh, it's showing all of...\n",
            "[19:07.360 --> 19:08.400]  I guess these are all the other...\n",
            "[19:09.440 --> 19:10.160]  What is this?\n",
            "[19:10.160 --> 19:12.960]  So we have Disk 8 through 13 here.\n",
            "[19:12.960 --> 19:14.640]  We don't have anything else plugged into here.\n",
            "[19:14.640 --> 19:18.800]  I'm guessing this is probably something to do with that extra partition it created on here\n",
            "[19:18.800 --> 19:21.120]  to get this working on a non-Apple machine.\n",
            "[19:21.680 --> 19:23.040]  But here's Hackintosh HD.\n",
            "[19:23.040 --> 19:24.160]  We're just going to erase this.\n",
            "[19:24.160 --> 19:26.240]  Mac OS Extended Journaled.\n",
            "[19:26.240 --> 19:27.200]  We'll erase.\n",
            "[19:27.200 --> 19:27.920]  Yes.\n",
            "[19:27.920 --> 19:28.800]  And that's done.\n",
            "[19:28.800 --> 19:30.720]  So we're going to close out of that.\n",
            "[19:30.720 --> 19:31.600]  Hit Continue.\n",
            "[19:32.240 --> 19:33.120]  Agree.\n",
            "[19:33.120 --> 19:35.360]  We're totally running this on Apple hardware.\n",
            "[19:35.360 --> 19:37.600]  Apple, no worries here.\n",
            "[19:37.600 --> 19:40.080]  And let's click Customize here.\n",
            "[19:40.080 --> 19:41.360]  So it doesn't add anything.\n",
            "[19:41.360 --> 19:43.920]  Again, this is like an unmodified copy of Snow Leopard.\n",
            "[19:43.920 --> 19:48.800]  The only thing it changed was the bootloader to allow this system to boot off of it.\n",
            "[19:49.600 --> 19:52.320]  But we could get QuickTime 7 if we want to.\n",
            "[19:52.320 --> 19:54.320]  I'm not going to really run PowerPC stuff on here,\n",
            "[19:54.320 --> 19:57.760]  so I'll just skip Rosetta if that would even work on here.\n",
            "[19:58.640 --> 19:59.920]  And we'll click on Install.\n",
            "[19:59.920 --> 20:02.320]  And it looks like it's going to take just over 30 minutes.\n",
            "[20:02.320 --> 20:04.160]  So let's hope for the best.\n",
            "[20:04.160 --> 20:05.760]  Oh my gosh, everybody.\n",
            "[20:05.760 --> 20:06.480]  Here we are.\n",
            "[20:06.480 --> 20:10.400]  We actually booted off of the hard drive and our mouse works.\n",
            "[20:10.400 --> 20:14.720]  And I didn't get to catch the intro video because I had stepped away\n",
            "[20:15.360 --> 20:17.280]  while it was finishing the installation process.\n",
            "[20:17.280 --> 20:19.120]  And then it obviously restarted and booted up.\n",
            "[20:19.120 --> 20:22.800]  But yeah, this is just great.\n",
            "[20:22.800 --> 20:23.760]  Like it feels so...\n",
            "[20:25.760 --> 20:29.280]  Again, it's such a great feeling after going through all this troubleshooting.\n",
            "[20:29.280 --> 20:30.800]  And yes, I should have done this first.\n",
            "[20:31.200 --> 20:32.560]  I do realize that now.\n",
            "[20:32.560 --> 20:36.960]  But I kind of wanted to explore IATK OS and kind of mix it up a little bit\n",
            "[20:36.960 --> 20:39.680]  by using that instead of just a regular CD.\n",
            "[20:39.680 --> 20:40.160]  Whatever.\n",
            "[20:42.080 --> 20:46.240]  I'm much happier going this route considering that it actually worked.\n",
            "[20:46.240 --> 20:49.360]  And we are going to have to go through and change the resolution.\n",
            "[20:49.360 --> 20:53.040]  That's the first thing I want to do because you can see it's still on that pretty low resolution.\n",
            "[20:53.840 --> 20:56.400]  But let's just put in my name here.\n",
            "[20:56.400 --> 20:57.600]  We'll just do MJD.\n",
            "[20:57.600 --> 20:59.280]  Actually, we'll do Michael for the account name.\n",
            "[20:59.280 --> 21:01.680]  And MJD for the password.\n",
            "[21:01.680 --> 21:05.520]  I keep saying whenever I type out this password in these videos,\n",
            "[21:05.520 --> 21:08.400]  I keep saying we'll use our super simple secure password.\n",
            "[21:08.400 --> 21:10.640]  A lot of people think it's 123.\n",
            "[21:10.640 --> 21:12.160]  I actually always do MJD.\n",
            "[21:12.160 --> 21:15.200]  I wonder if you can put the password hint as the password.\n",
            "[21:15.200 --> 21:15.920]  No, you can't.\n",
            "[21:15.920 --> 21:16.480]  Okay.\n",
            "[21:16.480 --> 21:18.480]  Well, then we'll say not 123.\n",
            "[21:20.880 --> 21:23.760]  But yeah, that's the password I always use for these videos.\n",
            "[21:24.400 --> 21:26.320]  So don't steal my bank login now.\n",
            "[21:26.320 --> 21:28.800]  Okay, because I totally use this for my actual bank.\n",
            "[21:28.800 --> 21:31.280]  We'll just stay in Pacific time zone.\n",
            "[21:31.280 --> 21:35.680]  And yeah, we're totally going to register this totally real Apple computer.\n",
            "[21:35.680 --> 21:36.800]  And there we are.\n",
            "[21:36.800 --> 21:37.360]  Look at that.\n",
            "[21:37.360 --> 21:39.680]  So this was relatively painless.\n",
            "[21:39.680 --> 21:44.800]  I was I'm honestly surprised that there aren't any graphics issues or, you know,\n",
            "[21:44.800 --> 21:46.560]  just other driver related issues.\n",
            "[21:47.280 --> 21:52.000]  We were able I mean, it's got the display driver, a display driver that works loaded.\n",
            "[21:52.000 --> 21:54.400]  It's able to detect USB devices.\n",
            "[21:54.400 --> 21:55.920]  Sound though, let's see if sound works.\n",
            "[21:55.920 --> 21:58.720]  Because again, I wasn't able to catch the intro video.\n",
            "[21:59.680 --> 22:00.640]  So let's oh, yeah.\n",
            "[22:00.640 --> 22:01.440]  Yeah, it works.\n",
            "[22:02.480 --> 22:03.040]  There you go.\n",
            "[22:03.040 --> 22:03.920]  So we got sound.\n",
            "[22:04.480 --> 22:07.200]  Let's see if the volume keys on.\n",
            "[22:07.200 --> 22:08.800]  Yes, they work too.\n",
            "[22:08.800 --> 22:09.440]  Look at that.\n",
            "[22:10.400 --> 22:11.520]  That's awesome.\n",
            "[22:11.520 --> 22:12.320]  Mute works.\n",
            "[22:12.880 --> 22:14.720]  Let's see if brightness, brightness works.\n",
            "[22:14.720 --> 22:15.120]  Okay.\n",
            "[22:15.680 --> 22:21.360]  But yeah, I mean, a good amount of the function keys up here work, which is awesome.\n",
            "[22:21.920 --> 22:23.200]  That's just really, really great.\n",
            "[22:23.840 --> 22:26.960]  So let's go to about here and see what it's recognizing this as.\n",
            "[22:26.960 --> 22:30.880]  So 1.6 gigahertz unknown, one gigabyte of memory.\n",
            "[22:30.880 --> 22:36.240]  And this is just standard 10.6 without any of the additional dot updates applied on top of it.\n",
            "[22:36.240 --> 22:40.080]  So let's hop into system preferences and go to display.\n",
            "[22:40.080 --> 22:43.280]  You know, this might actually be the maximum resolution.\n",
            "[22:43.280 --> 22:49.040]  So I just confirmed that this is actually the maximum resolution that this laptop supports.\n",
            "[22:49.040 --> 22:52.160]  So, you know, that's why we're not getting any higher resolution options here.\n",
            "[22:52.160 --> 22:53.040]  It still looks fine.\n",
            "[22:53.440 --> 22:57.040]  A few of the windows, like, you know, when we opened up system preferences originally,\n",
            "[22:57.040 --> 22:59.600]  it definitely goes off of the screen here.\n",
            "[23:00.160 --> 23:04.960]  But then when you go into like dock and then you go back, it does readjust it to,\n",
            "[23:04.960 --> 23:06.560]  you know, have the scroll bar here.\n",
            "[23:07.440 --> 23:09.840]  So that's honestly kind of unfortunate.\n",
            "[23:09.840 --> 23:10.960]  You have to do that every single time.\n",
            "[23:10.960 --> 23:12.800]  Like if you want to get to these bottom options.\n",
            "[23:12.800 --> 23:16.800]  But I don't think you can just resize the window, at least from the top here.\n",
            "[23:16.800 --> 23:17.360]  You can't do that.\n",
            "[23:17.360 --> 23:20.960]  So you would have to click on an option and then head back.\n",
            "[23:20.960 --> 23:23.120]  And then it has the scroll bar here.\n",
            "[23:23.120 --> 23:24.080]  So there you go.\n",
            "[23:24.080 --> 23:26.320]  Although let's change the dock because I think in this case,\n",
            "[23:26.320 --> 23:28.560]  it would make sense to have the dock hidden.\n",
            "[23:29.760 --> 23:34.880]  And we're definitely going to change the size of it a little bit and turn on magnification.\n",
            "[23:35.760 --> 23:38.480]  And yeah, that supports it pretty well.\n",
            "[23:38.480 --> 23:39.840]  No lag or anything.\n",
            "[23:40.560 --> 23:41.440]  So that's awesome.\n",
            "[23:42.080 --> 23:43.280]  Oh, it looks like a whoa.\n",
            "[23:43.280 --> 23:44.800]  Look what happened to the window up here.\n",
            "[23:45.680 --> 23:49.840]  It kind of lost its it lost its window over there.\n",
            "[23:49.840 --> 23:51.200]  They're back when we mouse over there.\n",
            "[23:52.880 --> 23:53.920]  Let's let's head back.\n",
            "[23:54.640 --> 23:55.040]  All right.\n",
            "[23:55.040 --> 23:58.560]  So yeah, I kind of just lost its theming for a minute here.\n",
            "[23:58.560 --> 24:00.960]  Let's get out of that and open it back up maybe.\n",
            "[24:00.960 --> 24:01.680]  And there we go.\n",
            "[24:02.400 --> 24:04.800]  So oh yeah, there now that that's actually much better.\n",
            "[24:04.800 --> 24:08.080]  Now that we don't have the dock, we can see the entire window on screen.\n",
            "[24:08.080 --> 24:09.440]  We just have to move it up a little bit.\n",
            "[24:09.440 --> 24:12.400]  So yeah, let's see if it still changes to the scroll bars, though.\n",
            "[24:12.400 --> 24:13.280]  I'm kind of curious.\n",
            "[24:14.000 --> 24:14.880]  It does not.\n",
            "[24:14.880 --> 24:15.200]  Okay.\n",
            "[24:15.200 --> 24:17.760]  So yeah, hiding the dock definitely helped there.\n",
            "[24:17.760 --> 24:20.080]  I'm going to lower the magnification a little bit.\n",
            "[24:20.080 --> 24:23.040]  It is a little bit too large for my life.\n",
            "[24:23.040 --> 24:25.280]  That's that I think that's more reasonable.\n",
            "[24:25.280 --> 24:26.640]  So let's just browse around here.\n",
            "[24:26.640 --> 24:29.680]  First thing we can do is eject the install USB.\n",
            "[24:29.680 --> 24:30.640]  So I'll do that.\n",
            "[24:31.360 --> 24:33.840]  And now we can pop that out of the laptop.\n",
            "[24:34.480 --> 24:37.440]  And let's open up Finder here and maybe let's see.\n",
            "[24:37.440 --> 24:40.560]  Let's go into applications and maybe try to run some stuff in here.\n",
            "[24:40.560 --> 24:41.680]  Oh, that's interesting.\n",
            "[24:41.680 --> 24:41.840]  Okay.\n",
            "[24:41.840 --> 24:44.960]  So netbook installer drops itself in the applications folder.\n",
            "[24:45.600 --> 24:47.040]  So we have that on here.\n",
            "[24:47.040 --> 24:49.200]  Oh, so there are some additional options.\n",
            "[24:49.200 --> 24:49.760]  Look at this.\n",
            "[24:49.760 --> 24:52.800]  So it's got the, you know, the only hard drive in here selected.\n",
            "[24:52.800 --> 24:57.200]  We have this checkbox here to install Dell Mini 10 V extensions.\n",
            "[24:57.200 --> 24:57.600]  Okay.\n",
            "[24:57.600 --> 24:59.600]  So that definitely sounds like something we're going to want.\n",
            "[24:59.600 --> 25:01.040]  And we've got some more options here.\n",
            "[25:01.040 --> 25:04.320]  A lot of this is like toggles to where you could come back in here\n",
            "[25:04.320 --> 25:07.040]  and re disable it if you enable one of these things.\n",
            "[25:07.600 --> 25:09.440]  So you can toggle remote CD.\n",
            "[25:09.440 --> 25:10.480]  So that's currently disabled.\n",
            "[25:10.480 --> 25:10.720]  Sure.\n",
            "[25:10.720 --> 25:11.360]  We'll do that.\n",
            "[25:11.920 --> 25:15.200]  And let's fix Bluetooth because apparently Bluetooth does not work out of the box.\n",
            "[25:15.200 --> 25:19.680]  So let's hit install and we'll type in our, again, that super secure password.\n",
            "[25:19.680 --> 25:19.920]  All right.\n",
            "[25:19.920 --> 25:22.160]  So I went ahead and timed the boot process there.\n",
            "[25:22.160 --> 25:26.880]  It took a minute and 10 seconds from when the Dell logo appeared at the beginning of\n",
            "[25:26.880 --> 25:29.280]  the boot up process to getting here.\n",
            "[25:29.280 --> 25:33.200]  So that'll give you an idea of, you know, how long that this will take.\n",
            "[25:33.200 --> 25:35.920]  And again, these are the system requirements that we're running with.\n",
            "[25:35.920 --> 25:41.680]  And just to compare my MacBook Pro 13 inch mid 2009, which was released,\n",
            "[25:41.680 --> 25:42.880]  you know, the same year that this came out.\n",
            "[25:42.880 --> 25:44.480]  Of course it costs a lot more.\n",
            "[25:44.480 --> 25:50.960]  It had a 2.2, 6 gigahertz Intel core two duo processor and two gigabytes of memory.\n",
            "[25:50.960 --> 25:56.880]  So we're here with a 1.6 gigahertz unknown, but it's an Intel atom and only one gigabyte of memory.\n",
            "[25:56.880 --> 26:01.120]  I would imagine definitely adding an SSD to this thing would vastly improve the\n",
            "[26:01.840 --> 26:04.000]  startup times and just overall performance.\n",
            "[26:04.000 --> 26:06.880]  So because we just have a regular hard drive in here.\n",
            "[26:06.880 --> 26:07.200]  Yeah.\n",
            "[26:07.200 --> 26:08.800]  I mean, there you have it guys.\n",
            "[26:08.800 --> 26:16.480]  That is Mac OS 10.6 Snow Leopard installed and working on the Nickelodeon netbook with\n",
            "[26:16.480 --> 26:20.800]  the additional patches applied from netbook installer here.\n",
            "[26:22.080 --> 26:22.640]  Definitely.\n",
            "[26:22.640 --> 26:25.120]  I mean, hey, I'm glad that we got it working in the end.\n",
            "[26:25.120 --> 26:27.360]  The boot times are not as bad as I thought.\n",
            "[26:27.360 --> 26:31.840]  I was kind of thinking, you know, especially with that hackintosh distro that we tried to install\n",
            "[26:31.840 --> 26:35.760]  in here with how long it was taking to boot up every time I thought, oh, this is going to be a while.\n",
            "[26:36.560 --> 26:40.800]  But, but no, I mean, a minute and 10 seconds, not really that bad.\n",
            "[26:41.600 --> 26:45.920]  Windows XP definitely starts up faster on this thing, but I mean, it's Windows XP.\n",
            "[26:45.920 --> 26:47.440]  This is Mac OS 10 Snow Leopard.\n",
            "[26:47.440 --> 26:49.440]  So you just, I mean, what are you going to expect?\n",
            "[26:49.440 --> 26:49.760]  Right.\n",
            "[26:49.760 --> 26:52.560]  But yeah, I hope you guys enjoyed this video.\n",
            "[26:52.560 --> 26:56.640]  If you did be sure to give it a thumbs up, get subscribed, all that good stuff.\n",
