            "[01:25.480 --> 01:27.160]  is what I see.\n",
            "[01:27.160 --> 01:32.160]  This is my setup, I guess some people might call it the battle station.\n",
            "[01:32.160 --> 01:35.200]  I don't really call it anything I just call it my computer.\n",
            "[01:35.200 --> 01:40.480]  But you can see that there are some interesting design choices that have been made.\n",
            "[01:40.480 --> 01:45.180]  This doesn't really look like a lot of other people's computers and probably the biggest\n",
            "[01:45.180 --> 01:48.280]  example of that is the desk itself.\n",
            "[01:48.280 --> 01:50.520]  You may notice it's kind of an odd shape.\n",
            "[01:50.920 --> 01:57.480]  It's basically a semicircle, it's a very angular semicircle because that's easier to build,\n",
            "[01:57.480 --> 02:02.760]  but it's intended to kind of wrap around the user as they swivel in their chair.\n",
            "[02:02.760 --> 02:10.120]  And that way if I'm sitting here I can reach all the way over to this side or all the way\n",
            "[02:10.120 --> 02:13.280]  over to this side without really having to move my chair.\n",
            "[02:13.280 --> 02:20.080]  If this was the same length of desk and it was straight then this corner would probably\n",
            "[02:20.120 --> 02:23.720]  be all the way over here somewhere.\n",
            "[02:23.720 --> 02:28.120]  And that would mean if I was sitting here in front of the keyboard I probably wouldn't\n",
            "[02:28.120 --> 02:29.120]  be able to reach it.\n",
            "[02:29.120 --> 02:31.600]  I would probably have to move my chair.\n",
            "[02:31.600 --> 02:35.120]  This was kind of inspired by 8bitguy's desk.\n",
            "[02:35.120 --> 02:37.480]  He built a similar wrap around you shape.\n",
            "[02:37.480 --> 02:39.040]  I think his is even longer.\n",
            "[02:39.040 --> 02:42.960]  I built this desk myself specifically to get this shape.\n",
            "[02:42.960 --> 02:45.420]  I don't think you can buy a desk that looks like this.\n",
            "[02:45.420 --> 02:47.640]  It does share some similarities with a corner desk.\n",
            "[02:47.640 --> 02:51.440]  The fact that you kind of work in the middle of this angle that it makes.\n",
            "[02:51.440 --> 02:53.080]  But I don't treat it like a corner desk.\n",
            "[02:53.080 --> 02:57.560]  Like it's up against a wall and I use the space behind to put lights and cameras and\n",
            "[02:57.560 --> 02:58.560]  things like that.\n",
            "[02:58.560 --> 03:03.660]  You can tell that I built it because there are some hints to its construction.\n",
            "[03:03.660 --> 03:08.560]  This is a long piece that's been cut in the middle at a 45 degree angle.\n",
            "[03:08.560 --> 03:13.480]  And then over here is the other half of that same piece, same 45 degree angle.\n",
            "[03:13.480 --> 03:17.440]  And then in the middle is just a straight piece that's been chopped off at the back.\n",
            "[03:17.440 --> 03:19.120]  It's not the most space efficient thing.\n",
            "[03:19.120 --> 03:22.040]  This takes up a considerable amount of the room.\n",
            "[03:22.040 --> 03:27.640]  But from a convenience and efficiency standpoint, it does give me a lot of table area all within\n",
            "[03:27.640 --> 03:28.760]  arm's reach.\n",
            "[03:28.760 --> 03:32.000]  Speaking of arm's reach, computer on the desk.\n",
            "[03:32.000 --> 03:36.600]  I'm probably the only person in 2022 who's using a horizontal PC.\n",
            "[03:36.600 --> 03:39.240]  And to be fair, it wasn't always like this.\n",
            "[03:39.240 --> 03:41.120]  This is a fairly recent addition.\n",
            "[03:41.120 --> 03:45.720]  I used to do what everyone else does and just shove a tower underneath the desk.\n",
            "[03:45.800 --> 03:48.160]  But that approach didn't really work with this desk.\n",
            "[03:48.160 --> 03:51.240]  Like I said, this is a deceptively long desk.\n",
            "[03:51.240 --> 03:53.080]  It's longer than it looks because it's curved.\n",
            "[03:53.080 --> 03:58.640]  So if I was to put the tower at one of the sides over here, to get cables all the way\n",
            "[03:58.640 --> 04:03.440]  over here, you'd probably need at least three meter long cables.\n",
            "[04:03.440 --> 04:08.960]  But then ideally, to save on both money and reduce cable mess over here, you'd have shorter\n",
            "[04:08.960 --> 04:13.040]  cables going from the PC to these components.\n",
            "[04:13.040 --> 04:16.680]  And then you're in kind of an awkward position of needing two different lengths of cable,\n",
            "[04:16.680 --> 04:19.200]  maybe three to get to the stuff in the middle.\n",
            "[04:19.200 --> 04:22.840]  And as you make changes to the setup, you may find that you don't have enough of one\n",
            "[04:22.840 --> 04:23.840]  of them.\n",
            "[04:23.840 --> 04:26.880]  Maybe you have too many one meters and not enough three meters or something like that.\n",
            "[04:26.880 --> 04:30.840]  So really for a desk that's this long, you need the computer in the middle.\n",
            "[04:30.840 --> 04:36.280]  And what I used to do was I had the tower backed in sideways against the wall.\n",
            "[04:36.280 --> 04:39.760]  And the advantage of that was that at least it was in the middle, all the cables could\n",
            "[04:39.760 --> 04:41.040]  be equal length.\n",
            "[04:41.200 --> 04:45.680]  But the downside of that was that turning the PC on was a real pain in the ass.\n",
            "[04:45.680 --> 04:52.320]  I had to reach all the way to the back, do these ridiculous gymnastics.\n",
            "[04:52.320 --> 04:54.320]  And the thing is, I'm getting old.\n",
            "[04:54.320 --> 04:56.960]  I can't be reaching under desks for the rest of my life.\n",
            "[04:56.960 --> 05:01.520]  And eventually I just kind of decided that I think ideally the PC should be on the desk.\n",
            "[05:01.520 --> 05:06.280]  I also know some people will put the computer behind here or behind here or can't really\n",
            "[05:06.280 --> 05:09.160]  put it behind here anymore because I got the four monitors.\n",
            "[05:09.160 --> 05:12.240]  This is also a relatively reason, haven't even gotten to the four monitors yet.\n",
            "[05:12.240 --> 05:13.240]  We'll get there.\n",
            "[05:13.240 --> 05:16.520]  But really I just thought, well, why don't I just have it right in front of me?\n",
            "[05:16.520 --> 05:19.400]  And the only real way to do that is to put it under the monitor.\n",
            "[05:19.400 --> 05:23.440]  Thankfully there is about six and a half inches between the monitor and the desk, so there\n",
            "[05:23.440 --> 05:26.480]  is just enough space for a horizontal PC.\n",
            "[05:26.480 --> 05:29.800]  So I rebuilt my PC into this case and it's been pretty good.\n",
            "[05:29.800 --> 05:33.200]  Going from reaching under the desk just to turn the PC on to just pressing the button\n",
            "[05:33.200 --> 05:36.840]  right here has been such a positive of doing this.\n",
            "[05:36.880 --> 05:41.200]  Also this has a five and a quarter inch bay in the front, but I figured, well, I need\n",
            "[05:41.200 --> 05:43.920]  a lot of USB, so why not just fill it with USB?\n",
            "[05:43.920 --> 05:46.440]  I have 10 USB ports on the front of this.\n",
            "[05:46.440 --> 05:48.520]  Currently this is taken up by an SD card reader.\n",
            "[05:48.520 --> 05:53.560]  I used to have a hub, so I had a powered hub that would plug into the computer underneath\n",
            "[05:53.560 --> 05:58.160]  the desk, but a high quality hub, especially for USB 3, can be pretty expensive and it\n",
            "[05:58.160 --> 06:01.360]  can add a lot of cable mess, not just the cable going down to the computer, but since\n",
            "[06:01.360 --> 06:06.400]  it was a powered hub, also the extra power brick strewn around having to plug in somewhere.\n",
            "[06:06.400 --> 06:11.520]  Whereas this, this is powered, it gets extra amps from the power supply, but absolutely\n",
            "[06:11.520 --> 06:12.520]  no cable mess.\n",
            "[06:12.520 --> 06:16.960]  I can just plug in hard drives, flash drives, controllers, anything I want right there.\n",
            "[06:16.960 --> 06:18.760]  Plus, this functions as a pretty good shelf.\n",
            "[06:18.760 --> 06:22.680]  I've got a hard drive plugged in, I can just, don't have to cover the desk with it.\n",
            "[06:22.680 --> 06:28.160]  I can also, if I need space over here to do hardware or something like that, just put\n",
            "[06:28.160 --> 06:31.360]  the keyboard up there, tuck my wrist rest underneath.\n",
            "[06:31.360 --> 06:33.760]  You can see I've got a wee sensor bar sitting on it right now.\n",
            "[06:33.760 --> 06:35.320]  You can tell my priorities are intact.\n",
            "[06:35.360 --> 06:40.520]  Oh, and if I need to open this up, rather than bending over, crawling under the desk\n",
            "[06:40.520 --> 06:44.960]  or anything like that, all I have to do, sorry it's hard to do with one hand, is pull the\n",
            "[06:44.960 --> 06:48.740]  PC out, pop off the top case, and I'm in.\n",
            "[06:48.740 --> 06:52.680]  Access to everything right on the desk, no bending over, nothing like that, and when\n",
            "[06:52.680 --> 06:56.920]  I'm done, just pop it back on and push it back in.\n",
            "[06:56.920 --> 06:57.920]  Couldn't be easier.\n",
            "[06:57.920 --> 06:59.640]  Again, I really like having the PC on the desk.\n",
            "[06:59.640 --> 07:03.140]  I know that for people with smaller desks it would be kind of a waste of desk space,\n",
            "[07:03.140 --> 07:04.400]  but for me, I think it works.\n",
            "[07:04.480 --> 07:08.000]  I've already got these other shelves here which I also built, and I used to also have\n",
            "[07:08.000 --> 07:12.080]  a shelf in the middle, but I replaced it with the PC, and while I lose some of that shelf\n",
            "[07:12.080 --> 07:13.840]  space, I think the compromise is worth it.\n",
            "[07:13.840 --> 07:16.880]  I think it's that nice having the PC right in front of me.\n",
            "[07:16.880 --> 07:19.720]  Fairly recent addition, I've had these three for a long time.\n",
            "[07:19.720 --> 07:25.480]  I've been a triple monitor user since like 2016, but I had a spare one sitting around,\n",
            "[07:25.480 --> 07:28.840]  and I was starting to feel like it would be nice to have a fourth monitor just so I can\n",
            "[07:28.840 --> 07:32.080]  put on Twitch streams or YouTube videos in the background while I work.\n",
            "[07:32.080 --> 07:35.320]  Of course, the camera, the capture of my face, the lights in the background.\n",
            "[07:35.320 --> 07:39.760]  Again, having everything in arms reach, the lights are controlled from a switch right\n",
            "[07:39.760 --> 07:40.760]  here.\n",
            "[07:40.760 --> 07:42.720]  There we go, so I'm off.\n",
            "[07:42.720 --> 07:44.480]  As you can see, how much of a difference it makes.\n",
            "[07:44.480 --> 07:50.040]  It's much darker in here now, but the lights point at the wall, and the wall bounces the\n",
            "[07:50.040 --> 07:51.440]  lights off to me.\n",
            "[07:51.440 --> 07:54.480]  That's to make the illumination a little more global.\n",
            "[07:54.480 --> 07:58.640]  Okay, so from left to right over here, this is just kind of a random drawer thing.\n",
            "[07:58.640 --> 08:00.720]  I just kind of put spare parts in it.\n",
            "[08:00.720 --> 08:04.400]  I knew I wanted a place to organize parts, but I haven't exactly figured out how I'm\n",
            "[08:04.400 --> 08:05.400]  going to do it.\n",
            "[08:05.400 --> 08:08.720]  Over here, this is a shelf I made, and it's got a speaker on it.\n",
            "[08:08.720 --> 08:11.800]  These are JBL 306Ps.\n",
            "[08:11.800 --> 08:13.880]  They're studio monitors, and they're a little dusty.\n",
            "[08:13.880 --> 08:14.880]  Sorry about that.\n",
            "[08:14.880 --> 08:18.680]  They're really useful because I also do things like audio mixing and music production here,\n",
            "[08:18.680 --> 08:20.280]  so I want to have good sound.\n",
            "[08:20.280 --> 08:22.200]  This of course is the microphone.\n",
            "[08:22.200 --> 08:24.760]  Underneath are screw containers.\n",
            "[08:24.760 --> 08:27.640]  If I'm taking something apart, I like to put the screws in there.\n",
            "[08:27.640 --> 08:31.240]  things organize and keeps things from falling off the table or anything like that.\n",
            "[08:31.240 --> 08:33.640]  This is a Blu-ray drive, Blu-ray burner.\n",
            "[08:33.640 --> 08:37.760]  I've had this for like over 10 years, and you might be thinking, why is this external\n",
            "[08:37.760 --> 08:39.840]  when I could have put it in the PC?\n",
            "[08:39.840 --> 08:44.360]  The idea is that while I do still burn disks every now and then, usually for some old video\n",
            "[08:44.360 --> 08:49.000]  game console or something, I don't do it very often, so I consider it a fairly temporary\n",
            "[08:49.000 --> 08:50.000]  thing.\n",
            "[08:50.000 --> 08:52.760]  If I want to swap in something else, I can just pull it out, put something new in, whereas\n",
            "[08:52.760 --> 08:54.800]  I know I'm going to want the USB all the time.\n",
            "[08:54.800 --> 08:58.520]  I consider that more permanent, so that's what I want to be in front of me all the time.\n",
            "[08:58.520 --> 08:59.520]  This is the Wii U.\n",
            "[08:59.520 --> 09:01.280]  That's what this sensor bar is for.\n",
            "[09:01.280 --> 09:03.000]  I'll put that back in place.\n",
            "[09:03.000 --> 09:05.200]  That's because I've got some Wii content coming up.\n",
            "[09:05.200 --> 09:07.840]  I'm not actually using the U part of this Wii U.\n",
            "[09:07.840 --> 09:12.240]  I'm mostly just using it for Wii games and its HDMI port just for convenience.\n",
            "[09:12.240 --> 09:16.480]  I've heard that the Wii's HDMI output on here is not that good, but it's the most\n",
            "[09:16.480 --> 09:18.280]  convenient thing I've got right now.\n",
            "[09:18.280 --> 09:20.520]  Underneath, the Wii mode and Wii U tablet.\n",
            "[09:20.520 --> 09:23.800]  Again, in the future, I may swap these out and put something else in.\n",
            "[09:23.880 --> 09:25.080]  This is a phone stand.\n",
            "[09:25.080 --> 09:27.040]  I sometimes put my phone on here.\n",
            "[09:27.040 --> 09:29.920]  Not all the time, but when I do, I can plug it in, get it charging.\n",
            "[09:29.920 --> 09:32.960]  It's actually connected to the PC, so I can get files off it as well.\n",
            "[09:32.960 --> 09:35.080]  This is the lens cap for this camera.\n",
            "[09:35.080 --> 09:36.920]  I figure I may as well keep it nearby.\n",
            "[09:36.920 --> 09:38.080]  Already going over the computer.\n",
            "[09:38.080 --> 09:40.240]  Over here is the audio interface.\n",
            "[09:40.240 --> 09:41.240]  Scarlett 2i2.\n",
            "[09:41.240 --> 09:42.240]  Everyone's got one of these.\n",
            "[09:42.240 --> 09:43.240]  Ethernet switch.\n",
            "[09:43.240 --> 09:46.720]  You might be wondering, why do I need an ethernet switch right on the desk?\n",
            "[09:46.720 --> 09:49.580]  In most cases, I probably don't.\n",
            "[09:49.580 --> 09:53.900]  It's just that sometimes I do, and when I do, it's really convenient to just have ethernet\n",
            "[09:53.900 --> 09:54.900]  right here.\n",
            "[09:54.900 --> 09:59.780]  A good example is the Halo video when I realised my iMac G3 wasn't connected to the internet.\n",
            "[09:59.780 --> 10:01.780]  Back then, I didn't have a switch here at all.\n",
            "[10:01.780 --> 10:07.260]  I had to unplug the ethernet from my PC and plug it into the iMac so I could send that\n",

            "[10:08.260 --> 10:12.580]  Then I forgot that my PC was recording audio at the time, which meant half of the audio\n",
            "[10:12.580 --> 10:14.980]  in that video got absolutely ruined.\n",
            "[10:14.980 --> 10:17.820]  From then on, I thought there were enough situations like that that I may as well just\n",
            "[10:17.820 --> 10:19.540]  have ethernet right in front of me.\n",
            "[10:19.540 --> 10:23.380]  If I'm working with a PS3 or some kind of hardware like that and I need it to connect\n",
            "[10:23.380 --> 10:25.060]  to the internet, just plug it right in there.\n",
            "[10:25.060 --> 10:26.060]  No problem at all.\n",
            "[10:26.060 --> 10:28.220]  Underneath, headphones.\n",
            "[10:28.220 --> 10:30.820]  These are actually the ones that I repaired.\n",
            "[10:30.820 --> 10:32.420]  It's got the ones with the socket mod.\n",
            "[10:32.420 --> 10:33.940]  I still use these to this day.\n",
            "[10:33.940 --> 10:35.380]  I wear them a lot on stream.\n",
            "[10:35.380 --> 10:36.380]  Notebooks.\n",
            "[10:36.380 --> 10:41.100]  I actually do find that when I'm hashing out a big problem or trying to solve some big\n",
            "[10:41.100 --> 10:46.580]  puzzle that it is easier for me to work it out on paper than it is on the computer.\n",
            "[10:46.580 --> 10:48.540]  For some reason, that just works for me.\n",
            "[10:48.540 --> 10:49.540]  This speaker.\n",
            "[10:49.540 --> 10:50.540]  Soldering station.\n",

            "[10:58.780 --> 10:59.780]  tuck it back in.\n",
            "[10:59.780 --> 11:02.500]  So that's most of the stuff on the desk.\n",
            "[11:02.500 --> 11:07.820]  Underneath the desk, I've got a footrest because I'm short and I've got a bunch of drawers.\n",

            "[11:17.620 --> 11:21.380]  In fact, some of them are empty because there are more drawers than things that I do, which\n",
            "[11:21.380 --> 11:22.380]  is good.\n",
            "[11:22.380 --> 11:23.380]  It's a good problem to have.\n",
            "[11:23.380 --> 11:24.380]  Just to go over them real quick.\n",
            "[11:24.380 --> 11:27.900]  This is hard drives, SD cards, USB flash drives.\n",
            "[11:27.900 --> 11:32.980]  This is tools, screwdrivers, scissors, cutting pliers, stuff like that.\n",
            "[11:32.980 --> 11:34.180]  This is capture.\n",
            "[11:34.180 --> 11:36.660]  So anything involved in capturing video.\n",
            "[11:36.660 --> 11:38.220]  That one is currently empty.\n",
            "[11:38.220 --> 11:40.260]  That one is camera supplies.\n",
            "[11:40.260 --> 11:44.180]  So things like lens cleaners, camera straps, battery chargers.\n",
            "[11:44.180 --> 11:45.180]  This is spare parts.\n",
            "[11:45.380 --> 11:49.220]  It's kind of just a miscellaneous like if there's any part that I could only buy in bulk, like\n",

            "[11:54.620 --> 11:55.980]  rest of them go in there.\n",
            "[11:55.980 --> 11:58.420]  Over here on the left is wires.\n",
            "[11:58.420 --> 12:00.300]  Power cables is at the top.\n",
            "[12:00.300 --> 12:01.300]  Second is data.\n",
            "[12:01.300 --> 12:04.220]  So things like USB cables, USB-C dongles.\n",
            "[12:04.220 --> 12:05.940]  Third one down is audio and video.\n",

            "[12:18.980 --> 12:20.740]  I think even multimeters go in there.\n",
            "[12:20.740 --> 12:23.300]  And the third one down is supplies.\n",
            "[12:23.300 --> 12:25.820]  It's kind of, I guess, the closest thing to a junk drawer.\n",
            "[12:25.820 --> 12:30.660]  So tape, pens, erasers, pencils, paper clips, push pins.\n",
            "[12:30.660 --> 12:33.100]  Anything that gets used up goes in that drawer.\n",
            "[12:33.100 --> 12:34.460]  Oh, I should mention this.\n",
            "[12:34.460 --> 12:37.700]  So this is a just a kind of generic blue switch keyboard.\n",
            "[12:37.700 --> 12:40.780]  I like blue switches because I do a lot of typing.\n",
            "[12:40.780 --> 12:44.280]  It's nothing special, but it works and it's worked well for quite some time now.\n",
            "[12:44.280 --> 12:46.920]  And this is a trackball.\n",
            "[12:46.920 --> 12:51.720]  So in 2018, I started having a lot of pain in my hand from using a mouse all the time.\n",
            "[12:51.720 --> 12:54.360]  And my dad suggested trying a trackball.\n",
            "[12:54.360 --> 12:56.320]  And I've been a trackball user ever since.\n",
            "[12:56.320 --> 12:58.100]  I've gone through many different ones.\n",
            "[12:58.100 --> 13:00.040]  This is the one that I've liked the best so far.\n",
            "[13:00.040 --> 13:01.600]  It's the Elacom Deft Pro.\n",
            "[13:01.600 --> 13:04.560]  I did replace the bearings in it because everyone says to do that and it's true.\n",
            "[13:04.560 --> 13:06.040]  It does make a huge difference.\n",
            "[13:06.040 --> 13:07.880]  But I've gotten very accustomed to the trackball.\n",
            "[13:07.880 --> 13:11.160]  I know that it's very different to a regular mouse and a lot of people just don't like\n",
            "[13:11.160 --> 13:12.160]  it because of that.\n",
            "[13:12.160 --> 13:13.800]  It takes a few days to adjust to it.\n",
            "[13:13.800 --> 13:16.160]  But since switching, I haven't had any hand pain like that.\n",
            "[13:16.160 --> 13:17.400]  So I think it really is better for me.\n",
            "[13:17.400 --> 13:19.800]  I even play games and first person shooters on this.\n",
            "[13:19.800 --> 13:21.200]  That's how used to it I've gotten.\n",
            "[13:21.200 --> 13:26.920]  So yeah, I think that pretty much sums it up as far as what stuff is on my desk on an\n",
            "[13:26.920 --> 13:27.920]  average day.\n",
            "[13:27.920 --> 13:29.160]  Usually it's actually a lot messier than this.\n",
            "[13:29.160 --> 13:30.600]  If you're thinking, man, there's a lot of cables.\n",
            "[13:30.600 --> 13:31.800]  It's not the cleanest thing in the world.\n",
            "[13:31.800 --> 13:35.000]  It's actually usually a lot messier than this because usually I've got a half finished\n",
            "[13:35.000 --> 13:37.400]  project over here and a half finished project over here.\n",
            "[13:37.400 --> 13:40.600]  But I tidied it up for the video so you get an idea what it should look like.\n",
            "[13:40.600 --> 13:42.360]  Chair, there's not much to say about that.\n",
            "[13:42.360 --> 13:43.720]  It's a steel case leap.\n",
            "[13:43.720 --> 13:46.440]  Secondhand because these things can be pretty expensive.\n",
            "[13:46.440 --> 13:50.480]  I don't know how well it compares to a brand new steel case leap.\n",
            "[13:50.480 --> 13:54.080]  I've heard sometimes the refurbished ones can be a little bit mediocre.\n",
            "[13:54.080 --> 13:57.920]  This one seems all right, but having never sat in a new one, I just have no idea.\n",
            "[13:57.920 --> 14:01.120]  I also replaced the wheels, their roller blade wheels.\n",
            "[14:01.120 --> 14:02.960]  They feel great to roll around on.\n",
            "[14:02.960 --> 14:04.520]  I did that for two reasons.\n",
            "[14:04.520 --> 14:07.920]  One just to get the chair up a little bit higher, but also they just feel really nice\n",
            "[14:07.920 --> 14:08.920]  to roll around.\n",
            "[14:08.920 --> 14:09.920]  It's super smooth.\n",
            "[14:09.920 --> 14:11.360]  It's like you're gliding around on a cloud.\n",
            "[14:11.360 --> 14:14.040]  I get a lot of questions about this long couch.\n",
            "[14:14.040 --> 14:15.380]  People ask, why is it so long?\n",
            "[14:15.380 --> 14:17.520]  Why would you buy something that long?\n",
            "[14:17.520 --> 14:19.320]  And the answer is I didn't.\n",
            "[14:19.320 --> 14:22.280]  This was actually donated to me from a friend's family.\n",
            "[14:22.280 --> 14:23.920]  They had upgraded their couch.\n",
            "[14:23.920 --> 14:26.440]  This one was just sitting in their garage and they were like, hey Matt, do you want\n",
            "[14:26.440 --> 14:27.440]  a free couch?\n",
            "[14:27.440 --> 14:28.440]  And I was like, absolutely.\n",
            "[14:28.440 --> 14:29.440]  So I took it.\n",
            "[14:29.440 --> 14:31.360]  It's actually supposed to be longer than this.\n",
            "[14:31.360 --> 14:34.800]  There's also a part of it that makes the couch L shaped and they asked if I wanted\n",
            "[14:34.800 --> 14:38.360]  to take it, but this already takes up almost all of my apartment.\n",
            "[14:38.360 --> 14:41.800]  And so I politely declined, but maybe if they held onto it and I moved to a bigger\n",
            "[14:41.800 --> 14:45.040]  place, maybe I can finally pick it up and complete it.\n",
            "[14:45.040 --> 14:49.120]  I also get questions about why is the couch just facing my computer?\n",
            "[14:49.120 --> 14:54.600]  Like what possibly could you be watching on this couch apart from the back of my head?\n",
            "[14:54.600 --> 14:57.240]  And the answer to that is not very satisfying.\n",
            "[14:57.240 --> 15:01.520]  It's simply my apartment is pretty small and there's nowhere else to put it.\n",
            "[15:01.520 --> 15:05.600]  If you think I'm balling off YouTube money, I mean, my setup is pretty cool, but as far\n",
            "[15:05.600 --> 15:09.480]  as my apartment goes, I mean, you're seeing pretty much all of it.\n",
            "[15:09.480 --> 15:15.200]  I do have a bedroom and I have a kitchen and a bathroom, but otherwise this is about it.\n",
            "[15:15.200 --> 15:19.240]  There really isn't space for a dedicated like living room.\n",
            "[15:19.240 --> 15:20.960]  I mean, technically this is a living room.\n",
            "[15:20.960 --> 15:23.400]  It's just, I needed the space to work.\n",
            "[15:23.400 --> 15:27.040]  So yeah, I think that pretty much covers everything.\n",
            "[15:27.040 --> 15:32.240]  My plan is because this setup evolves a lot that I'll do tours of my setup maybe once\n",
            "[15:32.240 --> 15:36.040]  a year or something like that, just to update people, show people what I've got going on.\n",
            "[15:36.040 --> 15:39.680]  Either way, I hope you enjoyed this video and I'll see you all in the next one.\n",
