            "[00:04.320 --> 00:11.240]  I ordered this pizza from the Nintendo Wii, a console that is almost 17 years old.\n",
            "[00:11.240 --> 00:13.400]  Is it the easiest way to order a pizza?\n",
            "[00:13.400 --> 00:14.640]  Well, no.\n",
            "[00:14.640 --> 00:17.800]  But when has this channel ever been known for doing things the easy way?\n",
            "[00:17.800 --> 00:20.440]  Hello everybody and welcome back to another video.\n",
            "[00:20.440 --> 00:24.360]  You know, we've done a decent amount of Wii modding stuff on the channel recently,\n",
            "[00:24.360 --> 00:28.160]  but what I'm going to show you today originally didn't require any of that,\n",
            "[00:28.160 --> 00:33.320]  because this was an official service made available by Nintendo in the Wii shop.\n",
            "[00:33.320 --> 00:36.280]  It's called the Demaille channel, and if you've never heard of it,\n",
            "[00:36.280 --> 00:40.520]  it's probably because you didn't live in Japan back in 2009 when it was released.\n",
            "[00:40.520 --> 00:44.720]  That's right, this is yet another case of Nintendo giving cool stuff to their home country,\n",
            "[00:44.720 --> 00:46.000]  which is understandable.\n",
            "[00:46.000 --> 00:50.640]  I mean, this was done in partnership with a Japanese delivery company called Demaille-Con,\n",
            "[00:50.640 --> 00:53.640]  which is where the logo and name of the channel come from.\n",
            "[00:53.680 --> 00:58.240]  In English, it translates to delivery channel, and it was pretty simple to use.\n",
            "[00:58.240 --> 01:00.600]  You would select what type of food you wanted to order,\n",
            "[01:00.600 --> 01:03.760]  or use this roulette button to have the channel decide for you,\n",
            "[01:03.760 --> 01:08.160]  and then just pick the restaurant you wanted to order from and the menu items you wanted to get.\n",
            "[01:08.160 --> 01:12.480]  After you ordered, you'd receive a confirmation, which is also sent to the Wii message board.\n",
            "[01:12.480 --> 01:16.080]  And none of your payment info was processed through this channel.\n",
            "[01:16.080 --> 01:19.080]  You had to pay your delivery driver when your food arrived.\n",
            "[01:19.080 --> 01:23.440]  So, if you're planning on paying with Wii points, well, you're out of luck.\n",
            "[01:23.480 --> 01:29.160]  The Demaille channel and its lesser-known Wii U counterpart functioned until March of 2017,\n",
            "[01:29.160 --> 01:31.160]  when Nintendo took the service offline.\n",
            "[01:31.160 --> 01:33.160]  But that doesn't mean it's gone forever,\n",
            "[01:33.160 --> 01:38.400]  because thanks to the work of the developers behind Wii Link 24, a Wii revival project,\n",
            "[01:38.400 --> 01:43.600]  this channel, along with some of the other Japan-exclusive ones, can be used once again.\n",
            "[01:43.600 --> 01:45.880]  And you don't even need to have a Japanese Wii.\n",
            "[01:45.880 --> 01:50.000]  And although it's not as easy as just typing a delivery address into an app on your phone,\n",
            "[01:50.000 --> 01:52.440]  it really isn't all that difficult.\n",
            "[01:52.440 --> 01:53.880]  So, here's how you do it.\n",
            "[01:53.880 --> 01:57.280]  First, you need to have the homebrew channel installed on your Wii.\n",
            "[01:57.280 --> 02:00.800]  If you haven't done that, head on over to this link and follow the steps.\n",
            "[02:00.800 --> 02:04.440]  You'll also need a Discord account to join the Wii Link 24 server,\n",
            "[02:04.440 --> 02:09.840]  an SD card formatted as FAT32, and a Windows, Mac, or Linux-based computer.\n",
            "[02:09.840 --> 02:14.280]  On your computer, head on over to wiilink24.com and click on the install button.\n",
            "[02:14.280 --> 02:17.720]  Select whatever operating system you're running and download the application.\n",
            "[02:17.720 --> 02:21.120]  Before you launch it, insert your SD card into your computer,\n",
            "[02:21.160 --> 02:23.800]  and make sure that the application recognizes it.\n",
            "[02:23.800 --> 02:27.160]  If it doesn't, press M to manually specify the path.\n",
            "[02:27.160 --> 02:29.000]  Then press 1 to begin.\n",
            "[02:29.000 --> 02:32.840]  Here you can choose to get the original Japanese language version of the channels,\n",
            "[02:32.840 --> 02:34.720]  or the English translation.\n",
            "[02:34.720 --> 02:38.600]  But note that if you actually want to order real food, you'll need the English version,\n",
            "[02:38.600 --> 02:40.040]  so that's what I'm gonna get.\n",
            "[02:40.040 --> 02:42.720]  Next, you'll choose which version of the food channel you want.\n",
            "[02:42.720 --> 02:48.440]  If you live in the US or Canada, you'll only be able to order from Domino's as of now, so hit 2.\n",
            "[02:48.480 --> 02:52.560]  If you're in any of these countries, you can use the food channel with Deliveroo,\n",
            "[02:52.560 --> 02:55.560]  giving you more ordering options, so select 3.\n",
            "[02:55.560 --> 02:57.960]  This does require some additional prep work, though,\n",
            "[02:57.960 --> 03:01.480]  as you'll need to download the Deliveroo Setup app from Wii Link sites\n",
            "[03:01.480 --> 03:03.520]  who link with your Deliveroo account.\n",
            "[03:03.520 --> 03:09.040]  And yes, sorry to anybody living in Japan, but this revival service isn't available there.\n",
            "[03:09.040 --> 03:13.400]  But there is this fake ordering version of the channel if you want to mess around with the interface.\n",
            "[03:13.400 --> 03:16.960]  Next, select your region for the Nintendo and Forkast channels,\n",
            "[03:16.960 --> 03:21.640]  and then choose if you're using a regular Wii slash emulator or the Wii U's VWii.\n",
            "[03:21.640 --> 03:27.000]  Then verify once more that the app has your SD card path correct, and let it do its thing.\n",
            "[03:27.000 --> 03:31.560]  Once it's finished, hit 3 to quit, eject your SD card, and put it into your Wii.\n",
            "[03:31.560 --> 03:35.800]  When you open up the homebrew channel, you should now see Wii Mod Lite in the list of apps\n",
            "[03:35.800 --> 03:37.520]  if you didn't already have it installed.\n",
            "[03:37.520 --> 03:41.680]  Open it up, go to WAD Manager, and choose the SD card as the source.\n",
            "[03:41.680 --> 03:43.920]  Then a list of WAD files will show up.\n",
            "[03:43.960 --> 03:48.200]  To order food, all you need are the food channel and Wii Link SPD WADs,\n",
            "[03:48.200 --> 03:53.120]  but I'm going to install all of them as Wii Link 24 does revive some additional services too.\n",
            "[03:53.120 --> 03:55.960]  Use the D-pad on your Wii Remote to move the cursor around,\n",
            "[03:55.960 --> 03:59.440]  and press the plus button to mark the desired WADs for installation.\n",
            "[03:59.440 --> 04:01.200]  Then hit A to install them.\n",
            "[04:01.200 --> 04:04.200]  After it's done, press the home button to return to the homebrew channel,\n",
            "[04:04.200 --> 04:08.960]  and then open up the Get Console ID app and write down what your console ID is.\n",
            "[04:08.960 --> 04:13.560]  This is needed to be sent in the Discord server to allow the channel to work with your console.\n",
            "[04:13.600 --> 04:16.720]  So join the Discord server and go through the onboarding process,\n",
            "[04:16.720 --> 04:20.880]  making sure to select the My Channel Real Ordering for the first question.\n",
            "[04:20.880 --> 04:23.480]  You can select the additional options too if you like.\n",
            "[04:23.480 --> 04:27.840]  Then find the Domino's Chat channel, click Complete and agree to the server rules,\n",
            "[04:27.840 --> 04:31.080]  and type slash dominoes followed by your console ID.\n",
            "[04:31.080 --> 04:34.600]  If it worked, you'll receive a message from the bot telling you you're good to go.\n",
            "[04:34.600 --> 04:37.760]  Then just hop back over to your Wii and open the food channel.\n",
            "[04:40.040 --> 04:43.080]  After you get through the welcome prompts and agree to the terms of use,\n",
            "[04:43.080 --> 04:46.400]  the channel will display an address card with placeholder info.\n",
            "[04:46.400 --> 04:49.840]  Click No and you'll be taken to the Address Information screen.\n",
            "[04:49.840 --> 04:53.280]  All you have to do is fill out the necessary info and click Done.\n",
            "[04:53.280 --> 04:56.280]  Then click Demi to be taken back to the food channel.\n",
            "[04:56.280 --> 05:00.640]  It'll then ask you to confirm your info again, so double check to make sure it's right.\n",
            "[05:00.640 --> 05:04.600]  It's worth noting that the state abbreviation for Texas will always appear\n",
            "[05:04.600 --> 05:07.560]  at the beginning of the second line, as this is a placeholder.\n",
            "[05:07.560 --> 05:12.160]  But the zip code, city, and street address should match what you've entered in on the previous screen.\n",
            "[05:12.200 --> 05:13.960]  And now comes the fun part.\n",
            "[05:13.960 --> 05:17.240]  Click Order and you'll be prompted to select your area of residence.\n",
            "[05:17.240 --> 05:20.280]  First choose your country, then state, then city.\n",
            "[05:20.280 --> 05:23.720]  If you live in a small town, there's a good chance it won't show up here,\n",
            "[05:23.720 --> 05:27.320]  so just click on any of the cities listed as it doesn't actually matter.\n",
            "[05:27.320 --> 05:31.920]  If you did everything correctly, you'll see a single pizza category on the next screen.\n",
            "[05:31.920 --> 05:36.040]  Click it and it will display a listing of dominoes locations closest to your address,\n",
            "[05:36.040 --> 05:38.680]  with the estimated amount of time it will take for delivery.\n",
            "[05:38.720 --> 05:41.760]  Select the one you want, click See Menu, and just like that,\n",
            "[05:41.760 --> 05:44.960]  you're browsing the entire Domino's Menu on your Wii.\n",
            "[05:44.960 --> 05:47.400]  So just go through and pick whatever you're in the mood for.\n",
            "[05:47.400 --> 05:51.200]  I went with a medium build-your-own pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms.\n",
            "[05:51.200 --> 05:54.840]  You'll have to choose your sauce as well, and if you want the correct option,\n",
            "[05:54.840 --> 05:58.160]  don't pick the first one or also end up with honey barbecue.\n",
            "[05:58.160 --> 06:01.800]  Oh, and it's worth noting that the price will show up in Japanese yen,\n",
            "[06:01.800 --> 06:04.480]  but it's really in whatever your local currency is.\n",
            "[06:04.480 --> 06:06.920]  Otherwise, I'd order like way too many of these.\n",
            "[06:06.960 --> 06:10.040]  Anyways, once you have what you want, hit Add to Basket.\n",
            "[06:10.040 --> 06:13.840]  There is an additional $5 delivery charge that isn't itemized here,\n",
            "[06:13.840 --> 06:15.920]  so that's why the total is what it is.\n",
            "[06:15.920 --> 06:19.320]  When you hit Next, you'll be able to confirm your order before submitting it.\n",
            "[06:19.320 --> 06:23.480]  Just like the original channel, your payment information is not processed through here,\n",
            "[06:23.480 --> 06:25.360]  so you won't have to enter any of that,\n",
            "[06:25.360 --> 06:28.840]  but you will need cash to pay and sip the driver when they arrive.\n",
            "[06:28.840 --> 06:31.200]  And now, for the moment of truth.\n",
            "[06:34.680 --> 06:35.840]  We got it, people!\n",
            "[06:35.880 --> 06:40.840]  I mean, well, you already knew that, but it's still nuts to me that this actually worked.\n",
            "[06:40.840 --> 06:44.960]  And if you're wondering, the Food Channel does keep a record of your deliveries,\n",
            "[06:44.960 --> 06:48.120]  and it will even pop a letter on your Wii message board,\n",
            "[06:48.120 --> 06:50.440]  just like it did back in 2009.\n",
            "[06:50.440 --> 06:56.520]  That way, you'll always have proof that you've successfully ordered pizza from the Nintendo Wii.\n",
            "[06:56.520 --> 07:00.720]  So, that's how you do it, and that's me going through the process.\n",
            "[07:00.720 --> 07:03.440]  All I have to say is, go try this out if you have a Wii.\n",
            "[07:03.440 --> 07:05.040]  I know it takes a little while to set up,\n",
            "[07:05.040 --> 07:09.920]  but it's just awesome that there's enough interest in this for people to actually spend the time\n",
            "[07:09.920 --> 07:12.720]  to revive the service and make it usable today.\n",
            "[07:12.720 --> 07:18.000]  So, huge thanks to the Wii Link developers, and huge thanks to all of you for watching.\n",
            "[07:18.000 --> 07:21.080]  If you enjoyed this one, be sure to give it a thumbs up and get subscribed,\n",
            "[07:21.080 --> 07:24.400]  and as always, I will see you all in the next video.\n",
